# Introduction

MiniShell is a product of objectification of labor. The shell, in its essence, is a mediator between the user and the complexity of the operating system, much like language is a mediator of reality. Indeed, it 
involves the construction of a user interface *and* an object language: as an object language, it is the objectification of the formal system of human-operating system interaction; as a user interface, it is the 
objectification of the human custom in this interaction.
Minishell applies computer science principles by founding on how software interfaces with hardware, how processes are managed, and how data flows through file descriptors. These elements are conceptualized through 
breaking each command and process into logical units that perform specific functions.
The operation of file descriptors and processes involves underlying physical principles of computing, including electricity flow through circuits and data representation through physical states (e.g., voltage 
levels). The manipulation of these descriptors in Minishell is a direct interaction with the physical properties of the computer along multiple levels of abstraction.
From a metaphysical perspective, MiniShell acts as a microcosm of order and control within the chaotic potential of the operating system. It reflects the philosophical quest for understanding and shaping the 
world (in this case, the operating system) through a structured framework of commands and processes. This mediation process is strictly related with [synchronization problems](https://github.com/fporciel2/Philosophers).
